## `Secret`

Kubernetes Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. Storing confidential information in a Secret is safer and more flexible than putting it verbatim in a Pod definition or in a container image

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in an image. Users can create secrets and the system also creates some secrets.

To use a secret, a Pod needs to reference the secret. A secret can be used with a Pod in three ways:

- As files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.
- As container environment variable.
- By the kubelet when pulling images for the Pod.
